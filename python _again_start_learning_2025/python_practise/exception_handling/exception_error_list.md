# exception_handling/exception_error_list.py
# This module contains a list of common Python exceptions that can be raised during program execution.
# Each exception is represented as a string for easy reference.
# The list can be used for documentation, error handling, or educational purposes.
# The exceptions included in this list are commonly encountered in Python programming.
# The list is not exhaustive but covers many of the standard exceptions that developers may encounter.
# The exceptions are listed in alphabetical order for easy lookup.
# This code is part of a Python script that handles exceptions
# and performs some calculations related to a restaurant's menu items.
# The code snippet below is commented out as it is not part of the exception handling logic.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# zeroDivisionError       #Dividing by zero raises this error.
# ValueError              #Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
# TypeError               #Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
# IndexError              #Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
# KeyError                #Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
# AttributeError          #Raised when an invalid attribute reference is made.
# FileNotFoundError       #Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
# ImportError             #Raised when an import statement fails to find the module definition.
# NameError               #Raised when a local or global name is not found.
# IndentationError        #Raised when there is an incorrect indentation.
# SyntaxError             #Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error.
# RuntimeError            #Raised when an error is detected that doesn't fall under any of the other categories.
# StopIteration           #Raised when the end of an iterator is reached.
# MemoryError             #Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
# RecursionError          #Raised when the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.
# OverflowError           #Raised when a numerical calculation exceeds the limits of the numeric type.
# SystemError             #Raised when the interpreter detects an internal error.
# UnicodeError            #Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.
# NotImplementedError     #Raised when an abstract method that needs to be implemented is not.
# BlockingIOError         #Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g., a socket).
# BrokenPipeError         #Raised when a write operation is attempted on a pipe that has been closed.
# ConnectionError         #Raised when a network-related error occurs.
# TimeoutError            #Raised when a timeout occurs.
# OSError                 #Raised when a system-related error occurs.
# EnvironmentError        #Raised when a system-related error occurs.
